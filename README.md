# Retail Bicycle Sales Analysis using SQL

## Project Background
This SQL-based project focuses on analyzing retail sales data related to bicycles, accessories, and cycling apparel. The dataset follows a star schema structure, with a central fact table capturing sales transactions and supporting dimension tables describing products and customers. This project aims to help stakeholders leverage SQL to uncover actionable insights across product categories, customer demographics, and sales channels. By using advanced querying techniques, the analysis helps identify high-performing products, evaluate customer segments, and track revenue trends over time. The insights derived from this analysis are valuable for marketing, sales, and operations teams, enabling data-driven decisions in areas such as product strategy, inventory management, targeted promotions, and customer retention.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset follows a star schema structure, consisting of one fact table and two dimension tables:

| Table Name     | Columns |
|----------------|---------|
| fact_sales     | order_number, product_key, customer_key, order_date, shipping_date, due_date, sales_amount, quantity, price |
| dim_products   | product_key, product_id, product_number, product_name, category_id, category, subcategory, maintenance, cost, product_line, start_date |
| dim_customers  | customer_key, customer_id, customer_number, first_name, last_name, country, marital_status, gender, birthdate, create_date |

## Executive Summary

This SQL-based analysis explores retail sales data from 2010 to 2014, uncovering key trends across products, customers, and countries. Bikes dominate sales, contributing over 96% of total revenue. The Mountain-200 and Road-150 models are top performers, with individual products generating over 1.3 million in sales.Revenue is nearly evenly split by gender, with a slightly higher spend from female customers. The United States and Australia lead in revenue, while France has the highest-spending individual customers. Sales peaked in 2013 with over 16 million in revenue, followed by a sharp decline in 2014. Most customers are new, highlighting an opportunity for retention and loyalty programs. To drive growth, the business should focus on expanding bike offerings, targeting high-performing countries, and converting new customers into repeat buyers.

Syntax :
To identify top-selling products, I aggregated sales revenue and ranked the highest-grossing items:

```sql
SELECT TOP 10
    p.product_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
    ON f.product_key = p.product_key
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

## Recommendations

### Product Strategy
- Prioritize inventory allocation and targeted promotions for the Mountain-200 and Road-150 product lines, which dominate top sales.
- Bundle high-performing bikes with accessories or apparel to increase average order value and address low revenue share in non-bike categories.
- Monitor products that showed consistent year-over-year growth (e.g., Classic Vests, All-Purpose Bike Stand) for potential seasonal restocking or promotion.

### Market Strategy
- Double down on high-revenue countries with lower customer bases like Australia and Canada by expanding marketing and localized offerings.
- Re-engage mid-tier markets such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom through region-specific campaigns and product visibility initiatives.
- Investigate the sharp decline in 2014 sales to address potential data gaps or operational bottlenecks.

### Customer Strategy
- Create tiered loyalty programs tailored to VIPs and Regular customers to increase retention and repeat purchases.
- Deploy onboarding sequences or personalized email flows to guide New customers toward higher-value tiers.
- Analyze purchasing behavior of high-spending individuals in France to replicate success in other geographies.

### Gender-Based Marketing
- Maintain balanced targeting as both genders show nearly equal purchasing power and engagement.
- Test messaging variations or product highlights tailored to each gender to optimize campaign performance.
- Encourage community engagement and reviews from both male and female customers to reinforce social proof across demographics.
